<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The writer has seldom enjoyed himself
more than in showing an American
friend over Oxford. He has felt something
of the same enjoyment in preparing,
with the hope of interesting some
American visitors, this outline of the history
of the University and her Colleges.
He would gladly believe that Oxford and
Cambridge, having now, by emancipation
and reform, been reunited to the nation,
may also be reunited to the race; and
that to them, not less than to the Universities
of Germany, the eyes of Ameri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>cans
desirous of studying at a European
as well as at an American University may
henceforth be turned.</p>

<p>It was once the writer's duty, in the
service of a Royal Commission of Inquiry,
to make himself well acquainted with the
archives of the University and its Colleges.
But he has also availed himself
of a number of recent publications, such
as the series of the Oxford Historical
Society, the history of the University by
Mr. Maxwell Lyte, and the volume on
the Colleges of Oxford and their traditions,
edited by Mr. Andrew Clark, as
well as of the excellent little Guide published
by Messrs. James Parker and Co.</p>

<p class="negin">o gain a view of Oxford from a
central point, we mount to the top
of the Radcliffe Library. We
will hope that it is a fine summer day,
that, as we come out upon the roof, the
old city, with all its academical buildings
lying among their gardens and
groves, presents itself to view in its
beauty, and that the sound of its bells,
awakening the memories of the ages, is in
the air. The city is seen lying on the
spit of gravel between the Isis, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Thames is here called, which is the scene
of boat races, and the Cherwell, famed for
water-lilies. It is doubtful whether the
name means the ford of the oxen, or the
ford of the river (<i>oxen</i> being a corruption
of <i>ousen</i>). Flat, sometimes flooded, is the
site. To ancient founders of cities, a river
for water carriage and rich meads for kine
were prime attractions. But beyond the
flat we look to a lovely country, rolling
and sylvan, from many points of which,
Wytham, Hinksey, Bagley, Headington,
Elsfield, Stowe Wood, are charming views,
nearer or more distant, of the city. Turner's
view is taken from Bagley, but it is
rather a Turner poem than a simple picture
of Oxford.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is in Oxford much that is not
as old as it looks. The buildings of
the Bodleian Library, University College,
Oriel, Exeter, and some others, medi&aelig;val
or half medi&aelig;val in their style, are Stuart
in date. In Oxford the Middle Ages
lingered long. Yon cupola of Christ
Church is the work of Wren, yon towers
of All Souls' are the work of a still later
hand. The Headington stone, quickly
growing black and crumbling, gives the
buildings a false hue of antiquity. An
American visitor, misled by the blackness
of University College, remarked to his
host that the buildings must be immensely
old. "No," replied his host,
"their colour deceives you; their age is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
not more than two hundred years." It
need not be said that Palladian edifices
like Queen's, or the new buildings of
Magdalen, are not the work of a Chaplain
of Edward III., or a Chancellor of Henry
VI. But of the University buildings, St.
Mary's Church and the Divinity School,
of the College buildings, the old quadrangles
of Merton, New College, Magdalen,
Brasenose, and detached pieces not
a few are genuine Gothic of the Founders'
age. Here are six centuries, if you choose
to include the Norman castle, here are
eight centuries, and, if you choose to include
certain Saxon remnants in Christ
Church Cathedral, here are ten centuries,
chronicled in stone. Of the corporate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
lives of these Colleges, the threads have
run unbroken through all the changes and
revolutions, political, religious, and social,
between the Barons' War and the present
hour. The economist goes to their muniment
rooms for the record of domestic
management and expenditure during those
ages. Till yesterday, the codes of statutes
embodying their domestic law, though
largely obsolete, remained unchanged.
Nowhere else in England, at all events,
unless it be at the sister University, can
the eye and mind feed upon so much
antiquity, certainly not upon so much
antique beauty, as on the spot where we
stand. That all does not belong to the
same remote antiquity, adds to the inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>est
and to the charm. This great home
of learning, with its many architectures,
has been handed from generation to generation,
each generation making its own
improvements, impressing its own tastes,
embodying its own tendencies, down to
the present hour. It is like a great family
mansion, which owner after owner has
enlarged or improved to meet his own
needs or tastes, and which, thus chronicling
successive phases of social and
domestic life, is wanting in uniformity but
not in living interest or beauty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oxford is a federation of Colleges. It
had been strictly so for two centuries,
and every student had been required to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
be a member of a College when, in 1856,
non-collegiate students, of whom there
are now a good many, were admitted.
The University is the federal government.
The Chancellor, its nominal head, is a
non-resident grandee, usually a political
leader whom the University delights to
honour and whose protection it desires.
Only on great state occasions does he
appear in his gown richly embroidered
with gold. The acting chief is the Vice-Chancellor,
one of the heads of Colleges,
who marches with the Bedel carrying the
mace before him, and has been sometimes
taken by strangers for the attendant of
the Bedel. With him are the two Proctors,
denoted by their velvet sleeves, named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
by the Colleges in turn, the guardians
of University discipline. The University
Legislature consists of three houses,&mdash;an
elective Council, made up equally of
heads of Colleges, professors, and Masters
of Arts; the Congregation of residents,
mostly teachers of the University or Colleges;
and the Convocation, which consists
of all Masters of Arts, resident or
non-resident, if they are present to vote.
Congregation numbers four hundred, Convocation
nearly six thousand. Legislation
is initiated by the Council, and has to
make its way through Convocation and
Congregation, with some chance of being
wrecked between the academical Congregation,
which is progressive, and the rural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Convocation, which is conservative. The
University regulates the general studies,
holds all the examinations, except that at
entrance, which is held by the Colleges,
confers all the degrees and honours, and
furnishes the police of the academical city.
Its professors form the general and superior
staff of teachers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each College, at the same time, is a
little polity in itself. It has its own
governing body, consisting of a Head
(President, Master, Principal, Provost, or
Warden) and a body of Fellows. It holds
its own estates; noble estates, some of
them are. It has its private staff of
teachers or tutors, usually taken from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Fellows, though the subjects of teaching
are those recognised by the University
examinations. The relation between the
tutors teaching and that of the professor
is rather unsettled and debatable, varying
in some measure with the subjects, since
physical science can be taught only in
the professor's lecture-room, while classics
and mathematics can be taught in the
class-room of the tutor. Before 1856 the
professorial system of teaching had long
lain in abeyance, and the tutorial system
had prevailed alone. Each College administers
its domestic discipline. The
University Proctor, if he chases a student
to the College gates, must there halt and
apply to the College for extradition. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the College the student immediately belongs;
it is responsible for his character
and habits. The personal relations between
him and his tutor are, or ought to
be, close. Oxford life hitherto has been
a College life. To his College the Oxford
man has mainly looked back. Here his
early friendships have been formed. In
these societies the ruling class of England,
the lay professions and landed gentry
mingling with the clergy, has been bred.
It is to the College, generally, that benefactions
and bequests are given; with the
College that the rich and munificent
<i>alumnus</i> desires to unite his name; in
the College Hall that he hopes his portrait
will hang, to be seen with grateful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
eyes. The University, however, shares
the attachment of the <i>alumnus</i>. Go to
yonder river on an evening of the College
boat races, or to yonder cricket ground
when a College match is being played,
and you will see the strength of College
feeling. At a University race or match
in London the Oxford or Cambridge sentiment
appears. In an American University
there is nothing like the College
bond, unless it be that of the Secret, or,
to speak more reasonably, the Greek Letter
societies, which form inner social circles
with a sentiment of their own.</p>

<span class="caption">DIVINITY SCHOOL, FROM EXETER GARDENS.</span>
</div>

<p>The buildings of the University lie
mainly in the centre of the city close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
around us. There is the Convocation
House, the hall of the University Legislature,
where, in times of collision between
theological parties, or between the party
of the ancient system of education and
that of the modern system, lively debates
have been heard. In it, also, are conferred
the ordinary degrees. They are
still conferred in the religious form of
words, handed down from the Middle
Ages, the candidate kneeling down before
the Vice-Chancellor in the posture of
medi&aelig;val homage. Oxford is the classic
ground of old forms and ceremonies.
Before each degree is conferred, the Proctors
march up and down the House to
give any objector to the degree&mdash;an un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>satisfied
creditor, for example&mdash;the opportunity
of entering a <i>caveat</i> by "plucking"
the Proctor's sleeve. Adjoining the Convocation
House is the Divinity School,
the only building of the University, saving
St. Mary's Church, which dates from
the Middle Ages. A very beautiful relic
of the Middle Ages it is when seen from
the gardens of Exeter College. Here are
held the examinations for degrees in theology,
styled, in the Oxford of old, queen
of the sciences, and long their tyrant.
Here, again, is the Sheldonian Theatre,
the gift of Archbishop Sheldon, a Primate
of the Restoration period, and as readers
of Pepys's "Diary" know, of Restoration
character, but a patron of learning. University
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
exercises used, during the Middle
Ages, to be performed in St. Mary's
Church. In those days the church was
the public building for all purposes, that
of a theatre among the rest. But the
Anglican was more scrupulous in his use
of the sacred edifice than the Roman
Catholic. In the Sheldonian Theatre is
held the annual commemoration of Founders
and benefactors, the grand academical
festival, at which the Doctorate appears
in its pomp of scarlet, filing in to the
sound of the organ, the prize poems and
essays are read, and the honorary degrees
are conferred in the presence of a gala
crowd of visitors drawn by the summer
beauty of Oxford and the pleasures that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
close the studious year. In former days
the ceremony used to be enlivened and
sometimes disgraced by the jests of the
<i>terr&aelig; filius</i>, a licensed or tolerated buffoon
whose personalities provoked the indignation
of Evelyn, and in one case, at least,
were visited with expulsion. It is now
enlivened, and, as visitors think, sometimes
disgraced, by the uproarious joking
of the undergraduates' gallery. This
modern license the authorities of the
University are believed to have brought
on themselves by encouraging political
demonstrations. The Sheldonian Theatre
is also the scene of grand receptions,
and of the inauguration of the Chancellor.
That flaunting portrait of George IV. in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his royal robes, by Lawrence, with the military
portraits of the Emperor of Russia
and the King of Prussia by which it is
flanked and its gorgeousness is rebuked,
mark the triumphs of the monarchs, whose
cause had become that of European independence,
over Napoleon. Perhaps the
most singular ceremony witnessed by
these walls was the inauguration of the
Iron Duke as Chancellor of the University.
This was the climax of Oxford
devotion to the Tory party, and such was
the gathering as to cause it to be said that
if the roof of the Sheldonian Theatre had
then fallen in, the party would have been
extinguished. The Duke, as if to mark
the incongruity, put on his academical cap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
with the wrong side in front, and in reading
his Latin speech, lapsed into a thundering
false quantity.</p>

<p>The Clarendon was built with the proceeds
of the history written by the Minister
of the early Restoration, who was
Chancellor of the University, and whose
touching letter of farewell to her, on his
fall and flight from England, may be seen
in the Bodleian Library. There, also,
are preserved documents which may help
to explain his fall. They are the written
dialogues which passed between him and
his master at the board of the Privy
Council, and they show that Clarendon,
having been the political tutor of Charles
the exile, too much bore himself as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
political tutor of Charles the king. In
the Clarendon are the University Council
Chamber and the Registry. Once it was
the University press, but the press has
now a far larger mansion yonder to the
north-west, whence, besides works of learning
and science, go forth Bibles and prayer-books
in all languages to all quarters of
the globe. Legally, as a printer of Bibles
the University has a privilege, but its real
privilege is that which it secures for itself
by the most scrupulous accuracy and by
infinitesimal profits.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BODLEIAN.</span>
</div>

<p>Close by is the University Library, the
Bodleian, one of those great libraries of
the world in which you can ring up at a
few minutes' notice almost any author of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
any age or country. This Library is one
of those entitled by law to a copy of every
book printed in the United Kingdom, and
it is bound to preserve all that it receives,
a duty which might in the end burst any
building, were it not that the paper of
many modern books is happily perishable.
A foundation was laid for a University
Library in the days of Henry VI., by the
good Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, who
gave a collection of books. But in the
rough times which followed, the Duke's
donation perished, only two or three precious
relics being saved from the wreck.
Sir Thomas Bodley, a wealthy knight and
diplomatist of the time of James I., it was
who reared this pile, severely square and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
bare, though a skilful variation of the
string course in the different stories somewhat
relieves its heaviness. In the antique
reading-room, breathing study, and
not overthronged with readers, the bookworm
finds a paradise. Over the Library
is the University Gallery, the visitor to
which is entreated to avert his eyes from
the fictitious portraits of founders of early
Colleges, and to fix them, if he will, on the
royal portraits which painfully attest the
loyalty of the University, or, as a relief
from these, on Guy Fawkes's lantern.
Beneath the Library used to be the
Schools or examination-rooms of the University,
scenes of youthful hopes and fears;
perhaps, as the aspirants to honours were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a minority, of more fears than hopes; and
at those doors formerly gathered the eager
crowd of candidates and their friends to
read the class lists which were posted
there. But the examination system has
outgrown its ancient tenement and migrated
to yonder new-built pile in High
Street, more fitted, perhaps, by its elaborate
ornamentation for the gala and the
dance, than for the torture of undergraduates.
In the quadrangle of the Bodleian
sits aloft, on the face of a tower displaying
all the orders of classical architecture, the
learned King and royal theologian. The
Bible held in his hand is believed to
have fallen down on the day that Mr.
Gladstone lost his election as Member<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
for the University of Oxford and set
forth on a career of liberalism which has
since led him to the disestablishment
of the Church. We stand on the Radcliffe,
formerly the medical and physical
library, now a supplement and an additional
reading-room of the Bodleian, the
gift of Dr. Radcliffe, Court Physician and
despot of the profession in the times of
William and Anne, of whose rough sayings,
and sayings more than rough, some
are preserved in his "Life." He it was
who told William III. that he would not
have His Majesty's two legs for his three
kingdoms, and who is said to have punished
the giver of a niggardly fee by a
prediction of death, which was fulfilled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the terrors of the patient. Close at hand
is the Ashmolean, the old University
Museum, now only a museum of antiquities,
the most precious of which is King
Alfred's gem. Museum and Medical Library
have together migrated to the new
edifice on the north side of the city.</p>

<p>But of all the University buildings the
most beautiful is St. Mary's Church, where
the University sermons are preached, and
from the pulpit of which, in the course of
successive generations and successive controversies,
a changeful and often heady
current of theology has flowed. There
preached Newman, Pusey, and Manning;
there preached Hampden, Stanley, and
the authors of "Essays and Reviews."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>Oxford and Cambridge were not at
first Universities of Colleges. The Colleges
were after-growths which for a time
absorbed the University. The University
of Oxford was born in the twelfth century,
fully a century before the foundation of
the first College. To recall the Oxford
of the thirteenth century, one must bid
vanish all the buildings which now meet
our eyes, except yonder grim castle to
the west of the city, and the stern tower
of St. Michael's Church, at once the bell
tower of the Church and a defence of
the city gate facing the dangerous north.
The man-at-arms from the castle, the warder
from the gate, looks down upon a
city of five or six thousand inhabitants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
huddled for protection under the castle,
and within those walls of which a fine
remnant is seen bounding the domain of
New College. In this city there is a
concourse of students brought together
to hear a body of teachers who have been
led, we know not how, to open their mart
of knowledge here. Printing not having
been invented, and books being scarce,
the fountain of knowledge is the lecture-room
of the professor. It is the age of
an intellectual revival so remarkable as
to be called the Medi&aelig;val Renaissance.
After the migrations and convulsions, by
which the world was cast in a new mould,
ensues a reign of comparative peace and
settled government, under which the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>sire
of knowledge has been reawakened.
Universities have been coming out all
over Europe like stars in the night; Paris,
famous for theology and philosophy, perhaps
being the brightest of the constellation,
while Bologna was famed for law
and Salerno for medicine. It was probably
in the reign of Henry I. that the
company of teachers settled at Oxford,
and before the end of the thirteenth century
students had collected to a number
which fable exaggerates to thirty thousand,
but which was really large enough to
crowd the little city and even the bastions
of its walls. A light had shone on youths
who sat in the shadow of feudal servitude.
There is no more romantic period in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
history of human intellect than the thirteenth
century.</p>

<p>The teachers, after the fashion of that
age, formed themselves into a guild, which
guarded its monopoly. The undergraduate
was the apprentice; the degree was
a license to teach, and carried with it
the duty of teaching, though in time it
became a literary title, unconnected with
teaching, and coveted for its own sake.
The University obtained a charter, elected
its Chancellor, formed its academical Legislature
of graduates, obtained jurisdiction
over its own members. In time it marshalled
its teachers and students into
regular Faculties of theology, law, and
medicine, with arts, or general and liberal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
culture, if the name can be applied to
anything so rudimentary as the literature
and science of that day, forming the basis
of all. At first the professors taught
where they could; in the cloisters, perhaps,
of St. Frydeswide's monastery, subsequently
absorbed by Christ Church; in
the porches of houses. A row of lecture-rooms,
called the Schools, was afterwards
provided in School Street, which ran north
and south just under the Radcliffe. So
little anchored was the University by
buildings, that when maltreated at Oxford
it was ready to pack up its literary wares
and migrate to another city such as
Northampton or Stamford. Many of the
undergraduates at first were mere boys,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to whom the University was a grammar
school. For the real University students
the dominant study was that of the School
philosophy, logical and philosophical, with
its strange metaphysical jargon; an immense
attempt to extract knowledge from
consciousness by syllogistic reasoning, instead
of gathering it from observation,
experience, and research, mocking by its
barrenness of fruit the faith of the enthusiastic
student, yet training the mind to
preternatural acuteness, and perhaps forming
a necessary stage in the mental education
of the race. The great instrument
of high education was disputation, often
repeated, and conducted with the most
elaborate forms in the tournaments of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Schools, which might beget readiness of
wit and promptness of elocution, but could
hardly beget habits of calm investigation
or paramount love of truth. The great
event in the academical life was Inception,
when the student performed exercises
which inaugurated his teachership; and
this was commonly celebrated by a feast,
the expenditure on which the University
was called upon to restrain. Oxford produced
some of the greatest schoolmen:
Duns Scotus, the "subtle," who had
written thirteen folio volumes of arid
metaphysics before his early death; Bradwardine,
the "profound," and Ockham,
the "invincible and unmatched." The
idol was Aristotle, viewed mainly as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
metaphysician, and imperfectly understood
through translations. To reconcile Aristotelian
speculation with orthodox theology
was a hard task, not always successfully
performed. Theology was, of course, first
in dignity of the Faculties, but the most
lucrative was the civil and canon law
practised in the ecclesiastical courts and,
as Roman, misliked by the patriotic Parliament.
Philosophy complained that it
had to trudge afoot while the liegemen
of Justinian rode high in the car of preferment.
Of physical science the hour
was not yet come, but before its hour
came its wonderful and almost miraculous
precursor, Roger Bacon, who anticipated
the invention of gunpowder and the tele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>scope,
and whose fabled study stood over
Folly Bridge, till, with Carfax's monument
and Cranmer's prison, it was cleared away
by an improving city corporation. Roger
Bacon was, of course, taken for a dealer in
black arts; an astrologer and an alchemist
he was, and at the same time an illustrious
example of the service indirectly rendered
by astrology and alchemy in luring to an
investigation of nature which led to real
discoveries, just as Columbus, seeking a
western passage to the golden cities of the
East, discovered America.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the Universities belonged not to one
nation but to Latin Christendom, the educated
population of which circulated among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
them. At one time there was a migration
to Oxford from the University of Paris,
which had got into trouble with the government.
Of all the Universities alike, ecclesiastical
Latin was the language. The
scholars all ranked with the clerical order,
so that at Oxford, scholar and clerk, townsman
and layman, were convertible terms.
In those days all intellectual callings, and
even the higher mechanical arts, were
clerical. The student was exempted by
his tonsure from lay jurisdiction. The Papacy
anxiously claimed the Universities
as parts of its realm, and only degrees
granted by the Pope's authority were current
throughout Christendom. When,
with Edward III., came the long war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
between England and France, and when
the confederation of Latin Christendom
was beginning to break up, the English
Universities grew more national.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incorporated with the buildings of Worcester
College are some curious little tenements
once occupied by a colony from
different Benedictine Monasteries. These,
with the Church of St. Frydeswide, now
Christ Church Cathedral, and the small
remains of Osney Abbey, are about the
only relics of monastic Oxford which survived
the Reformation. But in the Middle
Ages there were Houses for novices of the
great Orders, Benedictines, Cistercians,
Carmelites, Augustinians, and most notable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and powerful of all, the two great mendicant
Orders of Dominicans and Franciscans.
The Mendicants, who came into
the country angels of humility as well as
of asceticism, begging their bread, and
staining the ground with the blood from
their shoeless feet, soon changed their
character, and began in the interest of
Holy Church to grasp power and amass
wealth. The Franciscans especially, like
the Jesuits of an after day, strove to master
the centres of intellectual influence. They
strove to put the laws of the University
under their feet. Struggles between them
and the seculars, with appeals to the Crown,
were the consequence. Attraction of callow
youth to an angelic life seems to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
been characteristic of the Brethren of St.
Francis, and it is conjectured that in this
way Bacon became a monk. Faintly patronised
by a liberal and lettered Pope, he
was arraigned for necromancy by his Order,
and ended his days in gloom, if not in a
monastic prison. The Church of the
Middle Ages with one hand helped to
open the door of knowledge, with the other
she sought to close it. At last she sought
to close it with both hands, and in her
cruel panic established the Inquisition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tory in its later days, the University
was liberal in its prime. It took the part
of the Barons and De Montfort against
Henry III., and a corps of its students<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fought against the King under their own
banner at Northampton. Instead of being
the stronghold of reaction, it was the focus
of active, even of turbulent aspiration, and
the saying ran, that when there was fighting
at Oxford there was war in England.
Oxford's hero in the thirteenth century
was its Chancellor, Grosseteste, the friend
of De Montfort and the great reformer of
his day, "of prelates the rebuker, of monks
the corrector, of scholars the instructor,
of the people the preacher, of the incontinent
the chastiser, of writings the industrious
investigator, of the Romans the
hammer and contemner." If Grosseteste
patronised the Friars, it was in their
first estate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first the students lodged as "Chamberdekyns"
with citizens, but that system
proving dangerous to order, they were
gathered into hostels, or, to use the more
dignified name, Halls (<i>aul&aelig;</i>) under a Principal,
or Master of the University, who
boarded and governed them. Of these
Halls there were a great number, with
their several names and signs. Till lately
a few of them remained, though these had
lost their original character, and become
merely small Colleges, without any foundation
except a Principal. The students
in those days were mostly poor. Their
indigence was almost taken for granted.
Some of them begged; chests were provided
by the charitable for loans to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
A poor student's life was hard; if he was
earnest in study, heroic. He shared a
room with three or four chums, he slept
under a rug, his fare was coarse and
scanty, his garment was the gown which
has now become merely an academical
symbol, and thankful he was to be provided
with a new one. He had no fire in
his room, no glass in his window. As his
exercises in the University Schools began
at five in the morning, it is not likely that
he read much at night, otherwise he would
have to read by the light of a feeble lamp
flickering with the wind. His manuscript
was painful to read. The city was filthy,
the water polluted with sewage; pestilence
often swept through the crowded
hive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Medi&aelig;val students were a rough set;
not less rough than enthusiastic; rougher
than the students of the Quartier Latin or
Heidelberg, their nearest counterparts in
recent times. They wore arms, or kept
them in their chambers, and they needed
them not only in going to and from the
University over roads beset with robbers,
but in conflicts with the townspeople, with
whom the University was at war. With
the townspeople the students had desperate
affrays, ancient precursors of the comparatively
mild town and gown rows of this
century. The defiant horns of the town
were answered by the bells of the University.
Arrows flew; blood was shed on
both sides; Halls were stormed and de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>fended;
till Royalty from Abingdon or
Woodstock interfered with its men-at-arms,
seconded by the Bishop with bell, book,
and candle. A Papal Legate, an Italian
on whom national feeling looks with jealousy,
comes to Oxford. Scholars crowd to
see him. There is a quarrel between them
and his train. His cook flings a cauldron
of boiling broth over an Irish student. The
scholars fly to arms. The Legate is ignominiously
chased from Oxford. Excommunications,
royal thunders, and penitential
performances follow. Jews settle in Oxford,
ply their trade among the scholars, and
form a quarter with invidiously wealthy
mansions. There is a royal edict, forbidding
them to exact more than forty-three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
per cent interest from the student. Wealth
makes them insolent; they assault a religious
procession, and with them also the
students have affrays. Provincial feeling
is strong, for the students are divided into
two nations, the Northern and the Southern,
which are always wrangling, and sometimes
fight pitched battles with bows and
arrows. The two Proctors, now the heads
of University police, were appointed as
tribunes of the two nations to settle elections
and other matters between them
without battle. Amusements as well as
everything else were rude. Football and
other rough games were played at Beaumont,
a piece of ground to the north of
the city; but there was nothing like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
cricket field in the parks, nor like the sensation
now created by the appearance of a
renowned cricketer in his paddings before
an admiring crowd, to display the fruit of
his many years of assiduous practice in
guarding his stumps. The Crown and
local lords had to complain of a good deal
of poaching in Bagley, Woodstock, Shotover,
and Stowe Wood.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To this Oxford, with its crowd of youth
thirsting for knowledge, its turbulence, its
vice, its danger from monkish encroachment,
came Walter de Merton, one of the
same historic group as Grosseteste and
Grosseteste's friend, Adam de Marisco,
the man of the hour, with the right device
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
in his mind. Merton had been Chancellor
of Henry III. amidst the political storms
of the time, from which he would gladly
turn aside to a work of peaceful improvement.
It was thus that violence in those
ages paid with its left hand a tribute to
civilisation. Merton's foundation is the
first College, though University and Balliol
come before it in the Calendar in
deference to the priority of the benefactions
out of which those Colleges grew.
Yonder noble chapel in the Decorated
style, with its tower and the old quadrangle
beneath it, called, nobody knows
why, Mob Quad, are the cradle of College
life. Merton's plan was an academical
brotherhood, which combined monastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
order, discipline, and piety with the pursuit
of knowledge. No monk or friar was
ever to be admitted to his House. The
members of the House are called in his
statutes by the common name of Scholars,
that of Fellows (<i>Socii</i>), which afterwards
prevailed here and in all the other Colleges,
denoting their union as an academical
household. They were to live
like monks in common; they were to take
their meals together in the Refectory, and
to study together in the common library,
which may still be seen, dark and austere,
with the chain by which a precious volume
was attached to the desk. They had not
a common dormitory, but they must have
slept two or three in a room. Probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
they were confined to their quadrangle,
except when they were attending the
Schools of the University, or allowed to
leave it only with a companion as a safeguard.
They were to elect their own
Warden, and fill up by election vacancies
in their own number. The Warden
whom they had elected, they were to
obey. They were to watch over each
other's lives, and hold annual scrutinies
into conduct. The Archbishop of Canterbury
was to visit the College and see
that the rule was kept. But the rule was
moral and academical, not cloistral or
ascetic. The medi&aelig;val round of religious
services was to be duly performed, and
prayers were to be said for the Founder's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
soul. But the main object was not prayer,
contemplation, or masses for souls; it was
study. Monks were permanently devoted
to their Order, shut up for life in their
monastery, and secluded from the world.
The Scholars of Merton were destined to
serve the world, into which they were to
go forth when they had completed the
course of preparation in their College.
They were destined to serve the world
as their Founder had served it. In fact,
we find Wardens and Fellows of Merton
employed by the State and the Church in
important missions. A Scholar of Merton,
though he was to obey the College
authorities, took no monastic vow of obedience.
He took no monastic vow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
poverty; on the contrary, it was anticipated
that he would gain wealth, of which
he was exhorted to bestow a portion on
his College. He took no monastic vow
of celibacy, though, as one of the clerical
order, he would of course not be permitted
to marry. He was clerical as all Scholars
in those days were clerical, not in the
modern and professional sense of the term.
The allowances of the Fellow were only
his Commons, or food, and his Livery, or
raiment, and there were to be as many
Fellows as the estate could provide with
these. Instruction was received not in
College, but in the Schools of the University,
to which the Scholars of Merton, like
the other Scholars, were to resort. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
sort of grammar school, for boys of the
Founder's kin, was attached to the College.
But otherwise the work of the College
was study, not tuition, nor did the
statutes contemplate the admission of any
members except those on the foundation.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Merton's plan, meeting the need of
the hour, found acceptance. His College
became the pattern for others both at
Oxford and Cambridge. University, Balliol,
Exeter, Oriel, and Queen's were modelled
after it, and monastic Orders seem
to have taken the hint in founding Houses
for their novices at Oxford. University
College grew out of the benefaction of
William of Durham, an ecclesiastic who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
had studied at Paris, and left the University
a sum of money for the maintenance
of students of divinity. The University
lodged them in a Hall styled the Great
Hall of the University, which is still the
proper corporate name of the College.
In after days, this Hall, having grown
into a College, wished to slip its neck out
of the visitorial yoke of the University,
and on the strength of its being the oldest
foundation at Oxford, claimed as founder
Alfred, to whom the foundation of the
University was ascribed by fable, asserting
that as a royal foundation it was under
the visitorship of the Crown. Courts of
law recognised the claim; a Hanoverian
court of law probably recognised it with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
pleasure, as transferring power from a
Tory University to the King; and thus
was consecrated a fiction in palliation of
which it can only be said, that the earliest
of our literary houses may not improperly
be dedicated to the restorer of English
learning. Oriel was founded by a court
Almoner, Adam de Brome, who displayed
his courtliness by allowing his Scholars to
speak French as well as Latin. Queen's
was founded by a court Chaplain, Robert
Egglesfield, and dedicated to the honour
of his royal mistress, Queen Philippa.
It was for a Provost and twelve Fellows
who were to represent the number of
Christ and his disciples, to sit at a table
as Egglesfield had seen in a picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the Thirteen sitting at the Last Supper,
though in crimson robes. Egglesfield's
building has been swept away to make
room for the Palladian palace on its site.
But his name is kept in mind by the
quaint custom of giving, on his day, a
needle (<i>aiguille</i>) to each member of the
foundation, with the injunction, Take that
and be thrifty. Yonder stone <i>eagles</i> too
on the building recall it. Exeter College
was the work of a political Bishop who
met his death in a London insurrection.</p>

<p>As the fashion of founding Colleges
grew, that of founding Monasteries decreased,
and the more as the medi&aelig;val
faith declined, and the great change drew
near. That change was heralded by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
appearance of Wycliffe, a genuine off-spring
of the University, for while he was
the great religious reformer, he was also
the great scholastic philosopher of his
day. To what College or Hall his name
and fame belong is a moot point among
antiquaries. We would fain imagine him
in his meditations pacing the old Mob
Quadrangle of Merton. His teaching
took strong and long hold of the University.
His reforming company of "poor
priests" drew with it the spiritual aspiration
and energy of Oxford youth. But if
his movement has left any traces in the
shape of foundations, it is in the shape
of foundations produced by the reaction
against it, and destined for its overthrow.</p>

<span class="caption">NEW COLLEGE, CLOISTERS AND TOWER.</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>Yonder rises the bell tower of New
College over a famous group of buildings,
with ample quadrangle, rich religious
chapel, a noble Hall and range of tranquil
cloisters, defaced only by the addition of
a modern upper story to the quadrangle
and Vandalic adaptation of the upper
windows to modern convenience. This
pile was the work of William of Wykeham,
Bishop of Winchester, a typical
character of the Middle Ages, prelate,
statesman, and court architect in one,
who negotiated the peace of Bretigny and
built Windsor Castle. The eye of the
great architect as well as of the pious
Founder must have ranged with delight
over his fair creation. It is likely that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
New College, as a foundation highly religious
in its character, was intended to
counteract Wycliffism as well as to replenish
the clergy which had been decimated
by the Black Death. Wykeham was a
reformer in his way, and one of the party
headed by the Black Prince which strove
to correct the abuses of the court in the
dark decline of Edward III. But he was
a conservative, religious after the orthodox
fashion, and devoted to the worship
of the Virgin, to whom his College was
dedicated, after whom it was named, and
whose image surmounts its gate. The
College of St. Mary of Winton his foundation
was entitled. In its day it might
well be called New College. New it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was in its scale, having seventy Fellows
and Scholars besides ten Chaplains, three
Clerks, and sixteen Choristers for the services
of the Chapel, which is still famous
for its choir. New it was in the extent
and magnificence of its buildings. New
it was in the provision made for solemn
services in its Chapel, for religious processions
round its cloisters, for the daily
orisons of all its members. New it was
in the state assigned to its Warden, who
was not to be like the Warden of Merton,
only the first among his humble peers,
living with them at the common board,
but to resemble more a great Abbot with
a separate establishment of his own, keeping
a sumptuous hospitality and drawn by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
six horses when he went abroad. New it
was in having undergraduates as well as
graduates on the foundation, and providing
for the training of the youth during
the whole interval between school and the
highest University degree. Even further
back than the time of admittance to
the University, stretched the care of the
reformer of education. The most important
novelty of all, perhaps, in his creation,
was the connection between his College
and the school which he founded at Winchester,
his cathedral city, to feed his
College with a constant supply of model
Scholars. This was the first of those
great Public Schools which have largely
moulded the character of the ruling class
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in England. The example was followed
by Henry VI. in connecting King's College,
Cambridge, with Eton, and would
have been followed by Wolsey had he
carried out his design of connecting Cardinal
College with his school at Ipswich.
From the admission of an undergraduate
element into the College it naturally followed
that there should be instruction
of the juniors by the seniors, and superintendence
of study within the College
walls. This was yet another novelty, and
Wykeham seems to have had an additional
motive for adopting it in the low
condition of the University Schools, from
the exercises of which attention had perhaps
been diverted by the religious move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ment.
In the careful provision for the
study of Grammatica, that is, the elements
of Latin, we perhaps see a gleam of the
Renaissance, as the style of the buildings
belonging to the last order of medi&aelig;val
architecture indicates that the Middle Age
was hastening to its close. But it was one
of Wykeham's objects to strengthen the
orthodox priesthood in a time of revolutionary
peril. Ten of his Fellows were
assigned to the study of civil, ten to that
of canon, law. Two were permitted to
study medicine. All the rest were to be
theologians. The Founder was false to
his own generous design in giving a paramount
and perpetual preference in the
election of Fellows to his own kin, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
being numerous, became at length a fearful
incubus on his institution. It is not
likely that his own idea of kinship was
unlimited, or extended beyond the tenth
degree. All the Fellows and Scholars
were to be poor and indigent. This was
in unison with the medi&aelig;val spirit of alms-giving
as well as with the medi&aelig;val theory
of poverty as a state spiritually superior,
held, though not embodied, by wealthy
prelates. Study, not teaching, it is always
to be remembered, was the principal duty
of those who were to eat the Founder's
bread.</p>

<p>The Statutes of New College are elaborate,
and were largely copied by other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
founders. They present to us a half-monastic
life, with the general hue of
asceticism which pervades everything medi&aelig;val.
Here, as in the case of Merton,
there are no vows, but there is strict discipline,
with frugal fare. The Commons,
or allowances for food, are not to exceed
twelve pence per week, except in the times
of dearth. Once a year there is an allowance
of cloth for a gown. There is a chest
for loans to the very needy, but there is no
stipend. The Warden rules with abbatial
power, though in greater matters he requires
the consent of the Fellows, and is
himself under the censorship of the Visitor,
the Bishop of Winchester, who, however,
rarely interposed. Every year he goes on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
"progress" to view the College estates,
there being in those days no agents, and
is received by tenants with homage and
rural hospitality. The Fellows and Scholars
are lodged three or four in a room, the
seniors as monitors to the juniors. Each
Scholar undergoes two years of probation.
As in a baronial hall the nobles, so in the
College Hall the seniors, occupy the dais,
or high table, while the juniors sit at
tables arranged down the Hall. In the
dining-hall the Fellows and Scholars sit
in silence, and listen to the reading of the
Bible. In speaking they must use no
tongue but the Latin. There is to be no
lingering in the Hall after dinner, except
when in winter a fire is lighted on some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
church festival. Then it is permitted to
remain awhile and rehearse poems, or talk
about the chronicles of the kingdom, the
wonders of the world, and other things befitting
clerical discourse. This seems to
be the principal concession made to the
youthful love of amusement. As a rule,
it appears that the students were confined
to the College and its cloisters when they
were not attending the Schools of the
University. They are forbidden to keep
hounds or hawks, as well as to throw stones
or indulge in any rough or noisy sports.
The injunctions against spilling wine and
slops in the upper rooms, or beer on the
floor of the Hall, to the annoyance of those
who lodged beneath, betoken a rough style<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of living and rude manners. The admission
of strangers is jealously restricted, and
on no account must a woman enter the
College, except a laundress, who must be
of safe age. There were daily prayers for
the Founder's soul, daily masses, and fifty
times each day every member of the College
was to repeat the salutation to the Virgin.
The Founder's obit was to be celebrated
with special pomp. Self-love in a medi&aelig;val
ascetic was not annihilated by
humility, though it took a religious form.
Thrice every year are held scrutinies into
life and conduct, at which the hateful
practice of secret denunciation is admitted,
and the accused is forbidden to call for the
name of his accuser. Every cloistered soci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>ety,
whether monastic or academic, is pretty
sure to seethe with cabals, suspicions, and
slanders. Leave of absence from the College
was by statute very sparingly allowed,
and seldom could the young Scholar pay
what, in the days before the letter post,
must have been angel's visits to the old
people on the paternal homestead. The
ecclesiastical and ascetic system of the
Middle Ages had little regard for domestic
affection. It treated the boy as entirely a
child of the Church. In times of pestilence,
then common, the inmates of the
Colleges usually went to some farm or
grange belonging to the College in the
neighbourhood of Oxford, and those were
probably pleasant days for the younger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
members. Oaths of fearful length and
stringency were taken to the observation
of the statutes. They proved sad traps for
conscience when the statutes had become
obsolete, a contingency of which the Founders,
ignorant of progress and evolution,
never dreamed.</p>

<p>In the interval between the foundation
of New College and the revolution, religious
and intellectual, which we call the
Reformation, were founded Lincoln, All
Souls', Magdalen, and Brasenose. Lincoln,
All Souls', and Brasenose lie immediately
round us, close to what was the
centre of academical life. Magdalen we
recognise in the distance by the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
beautiful of towers. Lincoln was theological,
and was peculiar in being connected
with two of the Churches of
Oxford, which its members served, and
the tithes and oblations of which formed
its endowment. Its Founder, Fleming,
Bishop of Lincoln, had as a graduate
resident at Oxford been noted for sympathy
with the Wycliffites. But when
he became Bishop of Lincoln, the fact
dawned upon him that the Scriptures
too freely interpreted were dangerous.
He went over to the Reaction, burned
Wycliffe's body, and determined to found
a little college of true students in theology,
who would "defend the mysteries
of the sacred page against those igno<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>rant
laics who profaned with swinish
snouts its most holy pearls." His successor,
Bishop Rotherham, being of the
same mind, carried forward the work,
and gave the College statutes enjoining
the expulsion of any Fellow convicted of
favouring in public or in private heretical
tenets, and in particular the tenets
of "that heretical sect lately sprung up
which assails the sacraments, diverse
orders and dignities, and properties of
the Church." Rotherham had evidently
a keen and just sense of the fact, that
with the talismanic sacraments of the
Church were bound up its dignity and
wealth. The two orthodox prelates would
have stood aghast if they could have fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>seen
that their little College of true theologians
would one day number among its
Fellows John Wesley, and that Methodism
would be cradled within its walls.
They would not less have stood aghast
if they could have foreseen that such a
chief of Liberals as Mark Pattison, would
one day be its Rector. The history of
these foundations is full of lessons for
benefactors who fancy that they can impress
their will upon posterity.</p>

<p>All Souls' was designed by its Founder,
Archbishop Chicheley, <i>ad orandum</i> as
well as <i>ad studendum</i>; it was to serve
the purpose of a chantry not less than
of a College. The sculptured group of
souls over the gateway in High Street<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
denotes that the Warden and Fellows
were to pray for the souls of all Christian
people. But particularly were they
to pray for the souls of "the illustrious
Prince Henry, late King of England, of
Thomas, Duke of Clarence, and of all
the Dukes, Earls, Barons, Knights, Esquires,
and others who fell in the war
for the Crown of France." Of that
unhappy war Chicheley had been the
adviser; and seeing the wreck which his
folly, or, if the suspicion immortalised
by Shakespeare is true, his selfish policy,
as the head of a bloated Establishment
threatened with depletion, had wrought,
he may well have felt the sting of conscience
in his old age. The figures in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the new reredos of the Chapel tell the
story of the foundation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Magdalen was the work of Waynflete,
Bishop of Winchester and Chancellor of
Henry VI., another statesman-prelate who
turned from the political storm to found
a house of learning. Of all the houses
of learning in England, perhaps of any
country, that which Waynflete founded is
the loveliest, as he will say who stands
in its cloistered and ivy-mantled quadrangle,
either beneath the light of the
summer's sun or that of the winter's
moon. Some American architect, captivated
by the graces of Magdalen, has
reproduced them in his plan for a new University
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in California. Those courts,
when newly built, were darkened by
the presence of Richard III. Waynflete
came to Oxford to receive the king; and
this homage, paid by a saintly man, seems
to show that in those fierce times of dynastic
change, Richard, before the murder of
his nephews, was not regarded as a criminal
usurper, perhaps not as a usurper at
all. The tyrant was intellectual. In him,
as still more notably in Tiptoft, Earl of
Worcester, nicknamed for his cruelty the
Butcher, but literary and a benefactor to
the University, was something like an
English counterpart of the mixture in
the Italian Renaissance of culture with
licentiousness and crime. But as he sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
beside Waynflete in the Hall wooing popularity
by apparent attention to the exercises,
Richard's thoughts probably were
far away. A red rose among the architectural
ornaments is found to have been
afterwards painted white. It changed, no
doubt, with fortune, when she left the red
for the white rose. A new relation between
College and University is inaugurated
by the institution at Magdalen of
three Readers to lecture to the University
at large.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The old quadrangle of Brasenose remains
much as it was left by its co-founders,
a munificent Bishop and a
pious Knight. It is of no special his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>toric
interest, and its importance belongs
to later times. It absorbed several Halls,
the sign of one of which was probably
the brazen nose which now adorns its
gate, and so far it marks an epoch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quiet and sombre old quadrangle
of Corpus Christi lies yonder, by the side
of Merton, much as its Founder left it.
Now we have come to the real dawn of
the English Renaissance, a gray dawn
which never became a very bright day;
for in England, as in Germany and other
Teutonic countries, reawakened and emancipated
intellect turned to the pursuit of
truth rather than of beauty, and the great
movement was less a birth of literature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and of art than of reformation in religion.
This is the age of Grocyn, the teacher
of Greek; of Linacre, the English Hippocrates;
of Colet, the regenerator of education;
of Sir Thomas More, who carried
culture to the Chancellorship of the realm,
and whose "Utopia" proclaims the growth
of fresh aspirations and the opening of a
new era in one way, as Rabelais did in
another. Duke Humphrey of Gloucester,
uncle of Henry VI., had perhaps opened
the epoch at Oxford by his princely gift
of books, in which the Renaissance literature
was strongly represented, and which
was the germ of the University Library.
Soon Erasmus will visit Oxford and chant
in elegant Latin the praises of the classi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>cal
and cultured circle which he finds
there. Now rages the war between the
humanists of the new classical learning,
called the Greeks, and its opponents,
the Trojans, who desired to walk in the
ancient paths, and who, though bigoted
and grotesque, were, after all, not far
wrong in identifying heresy with Greek,
since the study of the New Testament in
the original was subversive of the medi&aelig;val
faith. Again, as in the cases of
Merton, Wykeham, and Waynflete, a
statesman-prelate turns in old age from the
distractions of State to found a house of
learning. Foxe, Bishop of Winchester,
was the chief counsellor and diplomatist of
Henry VII., in whose service he had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
doubt passed anxious hours and trodden
dark paths. It may have been partly for
the good of his soul that he proposed to
found a house in Oxford for the reception
of young monks from St. Swithin's Priory
in Winchester while studying in Oxford.
He was diverted from that design, and
persuaded to found a College instead, by
his friend Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter,
who is represented as saying, "What,
my Lord, shall we build houses and provide
livelihoods for a company of bussing
monks whose end and fall we ourselves
may live to see? No, no. It is more
meet, a great deal, that we should have
care to provide for the increase of learning
and for such as by their learning shall do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
good in the Church and Commonwealth."
Supposing the prognostication embodied
in these words genuine, they show that to
an enlightened Bishop the dissolution of
the Monasteries seemed inevitable. The
statutes of Foxe's College are written in a
style which affects the highest classical
elegance. They elaborate throughout the
metaphor of a bee-hive with its industrious
insects and its store of intellectual honey.
They embody the hopes of the Renaissance
and depict a College of the Humanities.
There is to be a Reader in Greek,
and for the subjects of his lectures a long
list of great Greek authors is assigned.
There is to be a Reader of Latin, for
whose lectures a similar list of Latin au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>thors
is given, and who is to keep "barbarism,"
that mortal sin in the eyes of a
devotee of the Renaissance, out of the
hive. Theology is not forgotten. The
Founder pays a due, possibly somewhat
conventional, tribute to its surpassing
importance. Of this, also, there is a
Professor, but its guides in interpreting
Scripture are not to be the medi&aelig;val textbooks,
such as Aquinas and the Master of
the Sentences, but the Greek and Latin
Fathers, including the daring Origen and
Augustine the favourite of Luther. The
Readers are to lecture not to the College
only, but to the University at large, a new
provision, connecting the College with the
University, which hardly took effect till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
very recent times. One of the first Readers
was the learned Spaniard, Juan Luis
Vives, whose appointment bespoke the
cosmopolitan character of the humanist
republic of letters. The statutes were
signed by the Founder with a trembling
hand eight months before his death, so
that only in imagination did he see his
literary bees at work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yonder to the south is Tom Tower,
where hangs the great bell, which, "swinging
slow with sullen roar," was heard by
Milton at Forest Hill. It was tolled a
hundred and one times for the hundred
and one students of Wolsey's House.
The Tower, or Cupola, was the work, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of Wolsey but of Wren. Around the
great quadrangle over which it rises are
seen the lines for cloisters which were
never built. The balustrade on the top
of the quadrangle is an alien work of
modern times. The Church of St. Frydeswide's
Monastery does duty as the
College Chapel, in place of the grand
Chapel in the perpendicular style, which,
had the Founder's plan taken effect, would
have stood there. Moreover, that which
should have been wholly a College is
made to serve and to expend a part of
its power as the Chapter of the Diocese
of Oxford, lending its Chapel as the
Cathedral, a niggardly arrangement which
has been productive of strained relations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
between occupants of the See and Heads
of the College. Ample and noble are the
courts of Wolsey. Worthy of his magnificence
is the great Hall, the finest
room, barring Westminster Hall, in England,
and filled with those portraits of
<i>Alumni</i>, which, notwithstanding the frequency
of pudding sleeves, form the fairest
tapestry with which hall was ever hung.
But it all falls short of Wolsey's conception.
Had Wolsey's conception been fulfilled,
Ipswich would have been a nursery
of scholars for Cardinal College, as Winchester
was for New College, and Eton
for King's College, Cambridge. The Cardinal
was an English Leo X. in morals,
tastes, perhaps in beliefs; a true Prince,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
not of the Church but of the Renaissance.
For him, perhaps, as for Foxe, it was a
refreshment to turn from public life, full,
as it must have been, of care and peril for
the Vizier of a headstrong and capricious
despot, to the calm happiness of seeing
his great College rise, and gathering into
it the foremost of teachers and the flower
of students. But in the midst of his
enterprise the sky of the Renaissance
became overcast with clouds, and the
storm of religious revolution, which had
long been gathering, broke. Forewarnings
of the storm Wolsey had received, for
he had found that in opening his gates
to the highest intellectual activity he had
opened them to free inquiry and to hetero<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>doxy.
Himself, too, had set the example
of suppressing monasteries, though he did
this not for mere rapine or to gorge his
parasites, but to turn useless and abused
endowments to a noble use. Wolsey all
but drew his foundation down with him
in his fall. The tyrant and his minions
were builders of nothing but ruin. Christ
Church, as at last it was called, was threatened
with confiscation and destruction,
but was finally spared in its incomplete
condition, appropriated by Henry as his
own foundation, and dedicated to the
honour of the king, whose portrait, in
its usual attitude of obtrusive self-conceit,
occupies in the Hall the central place,
where the portrait of the Cardinal should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
be. The Cardinal's hat, on the outer wall
of the house, is left to speak of the true
Founder. That the College was to be
called after its Founder's name, not, like
the Colleges of Wykeham and Waynflete,
after the name of a Saint, seems a symptom
of the pride which went before
Wolsey's fall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now come upon the hapless University
forty years of religious revolution, the
monuments of which are traces of destruction
and records of proscription. All
the monastic houses and houses for monastic
novices were forfeited to the Crown,
and their buildings were left desolate,
though, from the ruins of some of them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
new Colleges were afterwards to rise.
Libraries which would now be priceless,
were sacked and destroyed because the
illumination on the manuscripts was Popish.
It was the least to be deplored of
all the havoc, that the torn leaves of the
arid tomes of Duns Scotus were seen
flying about the quadrangle of New College,
while a sporting gentleman of the
neighbourhood was picking them up to
be used in driving the deer. There is a
comic monument of the religious revolution
in the coffer shrine at Christ Church,
in which the dust of Catherine, wife of
the Protestant Doctor, Peter Martyr, is
mingled with that of the Catholic Saint,
Frydeswide. Catholicism, in its hour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
triumph under Mary, had dug up the
corpse of the heretic's concubine and
buried it under a dung-hill. Protestantism,
once more victorious, rescued the
remains, and guarded against a repetition
of the outrage, in case fortune should
again change, by mingling them with
those of the Catholic Saint. A more
tragic memorial of the conflict is yonder
recumbent cross in Broad Street, close
to the spot, then a portion of the town
ditch, where Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley
died. Bocardo, the prison over the
neighbouring gate of the city, from the
window of which Cranmer, then confined
there, witnessed the burning of Latimer
and Ridley, was pulled down at the begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ning
of this century. The Divinity
School, Christ Church Cathedral, and
St. Mary's Church witnessed different
scenes of the drama. St. Mary's witnessed
that last scene, in which Cranmer
filled his enemies with fury and confusion
by suddenly recanting his recantation,
and declaring that the hand which had
signed it should burn first. College archives
record the expulsion, readmission,
and re-expulsion of Heads and Fellows,
as victory inclined to the Protestant or
Catholic side. So perished the English
Renaissance. For the cultivation of the
humanities there could be no room in a
centre of religious strife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fatal bequests of the religious war were
the religious tests. Leicester, as Chancellor,
introduced subscription to the Thirty-nine
Articles to keep out Romanists;
King James, that to the three articles of
the Thirty-sixth Canon to keep out Puritans.
These tests, involving scores of
controverted propositions in theology,
were imposed on the consciences of mere
boys. The Universities were thus taken
from the nation and given to the State
Church, which, in the course of time, as dissent
from its doctrines gained ground, came
to be far from identical with the nation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the first lull, however, new Colleges
arose, partly out of the ruins of the monas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>tic
houses of the past. Trinity College,
of which the quiet old quadrangle is curiously
mated with a fantastic Chapel of
much later date, was founded out of the
ruin of Durham College, a Benedictine
House. Its Founder, Sir Thomas Pope,
was one of that group of highly educated
lay statesmen, eminent both in the councils
of kings and among the patrons of
learning, which succeeded the great Prelates
of the Middle Ages. He was a
Catholic, as his statutes show; but a liberal
Catholic, not unfriendly to light,
though little knowing perhaps whither it
would lead him. Among his friends was
Sir Nicholas Bacon, who bequeathed to
him the splendid whistle, then used to call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
servants, which is seen round his neck in
his portrait. Another of his friends was
Pole, who showed his intellectual liberality
by recommending him to enjoin in his
statutes the study of Greek. St. John's
College, again, rose out of the wreck of
a Bernardine House. The Founder was
not a statesman or a prelate, but a great
citizen, Sir Thomas White, sometime
Lord Mayor of London, who had amassed
wealth in trade, and made a noble use of
it. White also was of the olden faith.
That the storm was not over when his
College was founded is tragically shown
by the fate of Campion, who, when White
was laid in the College Chapel, preached
the funeral sermon, and afterwards becoming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a Jesuit and an emissary of his Order,
was brought to the rack and to the scaffold.
There was also a great secession of
Fellows when the final rupture took place
between Rome and Elizabeth. In the
group of cultivated Knights and statesmen,
who patronised learning and education,
may be placed Sir William Petre, the
second Founder of Exeter College, whose
monument is its old quadrangle, and Sir
Thomas Bodley, whose monument is the
Bodleian Library. If Petre and Bodley
were Protestants, while Pope and White
were Catholics, the difference was rather
political than religious. In religion the
public men changed with the national
government, little sharing the passions of
either theological party.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>Jesus, whose old quadrangle, chapel,
and hall belong to early Stuart times, was
the first distinctly Protestant College.
This its name, in contrast with Colleges
named after Saints, denotes. The second
Protestant College was Wadham, the
buildings of which stand in their pristine
beauty, vying with Magdalen, perhaps
even excelling it in the special air of a
house of learning, and proving that to
be interesting and impressive it is not
necessary to be medi&aelig;val. At the same
time Wadham shows how long the spirit
of the Middle Ages clung to Oxford;
for the style of the Chapel is anterior
by a century and a half to the date.
Here we have a conscious desire, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
part of the architect, to recall the past.
The Founder, Sir Nicholas Wadham, was
a wealthy Western land-owner. We may
dismiss the tradition that his first design
was to found a College of Roman Catholic
priests in Italy, and his second to
found a Protestant College at Oxford, as
at most significant of the prolonged wavering
of the religious balance in the minds
of a number of the wealthier class. The
statutes were, in the main, like those of
the medi&aelig;val Colleges, saving in making
the Fellowship terminable after about
twenty-two years, thus more clearly designating
the College as a school for active
life. The prohibition of marriage was
retained, not as an ascetic ordinance, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
as a concomitant of the College system.
In the medi&aelig;val Colleges it was not
necessary to extend the prohibition to the
Heads, who, being priests, were bound
to celibacy by the regulations of their
Order; but marriage being now permitted
to the clergy generally, the prohibition
was in the statutes of Wadham
expressly extended, in the interest of the
College system, to the Head. Hence it
is an aspersion on the reputation of
Dame Dorothy Wadham, who, after her
husband's death, carried out his design,
and whose effigy kneels opposite that of
her loving lord in the old quadrangle, to
say that she was in love with the first
Warden, and because he would not marry

<p>These foundations, followed by that of
Pembroke and the building of the South
quadrangle of Merton, of the South quadrangle
of Lincoln, of the West front of St.
John's, of the quadrangle and hall of Exeter,
of part of the quadrangle of Oriel, of
the West quadrangle of University College,
as well as of the Bodleian Library,
the Schools' quadrangle, the Convocation
House, and of the gateway of the Botanic
Garden, prove that, though the old University
system, with its scholastic exercises,
had become hollow, there was life in Oxford,
and the interest of patrons of learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>ing
was attracted to it during the period
between the Reformation and the Rebellion.
It was also felt to be a centre of
power. Elizabeth twice visited it, once
in the heyday of her youthful glory, and
again in her haggard decline. On the
first occasion she exerted with effect those
arts of popularity which were the best part
of her statesmanship. On both occasions
she was received with ecstatic flattery and
entertained with academical exercises at
tedious length, and plays, to our taste not
less tedious, performed in College Halls.
Her successor could not fail to exhibit
himself in a seat of learning, where he
felt supreme, and, to do him justice, was
not unqualified, to shine. To his benig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>nity
the University owes the questionable
privilege of sending two members to the
House of Commons, whereby it became
entangled in political as well as in theological
frays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great changes, however, had by this
time passed or were passing over the University.
As in former days the Halls had
absorbed the Chamberdekyns, so the Colleges
had now almost absorbed the Halls.
They did this, not by any aggression, but
by the natural advantages of wealth, their
riches always increasing with the value of
land, and by their reputation. Most of
them, in addition to the members on the
foundation, took students as boarders, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
they got the best and wealthiest. Universities,
losing their pristine character as
marts of available knowledge, and becoming
places of general education, ceased, by
a process equally natural, to be the heritage
of the poor and became the resort of
the rich. The medi&aelig;val statutes of the
Colleges still limited the foundations to
the poor, but even these in time, by cunning
interpretation, were largely evaded.
Already in the later Middle Ages Oxford
had received, and, it seems, too complacently
received, young scions of the aristocracy
and gentry, the precursors of the
noblemen and the silk-gowned gentleman-commoners
of a later day. The Black
Prince had been for a short time at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Queen's College. In the reign of Henry
VI., George Neville, the brother of the
King-maker, had celebrated the taking of
his degree, a process which was probably
made easy to him, with banquets which
lasted through two days on a prodigious
scale. At the same time and for the same
causes the system of College instruction
grew in importance and gradually ousted
the lectures of University Professors.
Fellows of Colleges were not unwilling
to add to their Commons and Livery the
Tutor's stipend. Thus the importance of
the College waxed while that of the University
waned, and the College Statutes
became more and more collectively the
law of the University. These Statutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
were medi&aelig;val and obsolete, but they were
unalterable, the Heads and Fellows being
sworn to their observance, and there being
no power of amendment, since the Visitor
could only interpret and enforce. Thus
the medi&aelig;val type of life and study was
stereotyped and progress was barred. The
Fellowships having been originally not
teacherships or prizes, but aids to poor
students, the Founders deemed themselves
at liberty in regulating the elections to
give free play to their local and family
partialities, and the consequence was a
mass of preferences to favoured counties
or to kin. With all these limitations, the
teaching body of the University was now
practically saddled. Even the restrictions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to particular schools&mdash;as to Winchester
in the case of New College, to Westminster,
which had been substituted for
Wolsey's Ipswich, in the case of Christ
Church, and to Merchant Tailors' School
in the case of St. John's&mdash;were noxious,
though in a less degree, albeit their bad
influence might be redeemed by some
pleasant associations. Worst of all, however,
in their effect were the restrictions
to the clerical Order. This meant little
in the Middle Ages, when all intellectual
callings were clerical, when at Oxford
gownsman and clerk, townsman and laic,
were convertible terms. Wykeham, Foxe,
and Wolsey themselves were thorough
laymen in their pursuits and character,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
though they had received the tonsure,
were qualified, if they pleased, to celebrate
mass, and derived their incomes from bishoprics
and abbeys. But the Reformation
drew a sharp line between the clerical and
the other professions. The clergyman was
henceforth a pastor. The resident body
of graduates and the teaching staff of Oxford
belonging almost exclusively to the
clerical profession, the studies and interests
of that profession now reigned alone.
Whatever life remained to the University
was chiefly absorbed in theological study
and controversy. This was the more deplorable
as theology, in the medi&aelig;val
sense, was a science almost as extinct as
astrology or alchemy. Oxford was turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
into the cock-pit of theological party. At
the same time she was bound hand and
foot to a political faction, because her
clergymen belonged to the Episcopal and
State Church, the patrons and upholders
of which, from political motives, were the
Kings and the Cavaliers, or, as they were
afterwards called, the Tories. Cambridge
suffered like Oxford, though with some
abatement, because there, owing to the
vicinity of a great Puritan district, high
Anglicanism did not prevail, and, for
reasons difficult to define, the clergy altogether
were less clerical. Newton was
near forfeiting his Fellowship and the
means of prosecuting his speculations because
he was not in Holy Orders. Luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>ily,
a Lay Fellowship fell just in time.
Let Founders, and all who have a passion
for regulating the lives of other people,
for propagating their wills beyond the
reach of their foresight, and for grasping
posterity, as it were, with a dead hand,
take warning by a disastrous example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the Colleges became the University,
their Heads became the governors of the
University. They formed a Board called
the Hebdomadal Council, which initiated
all legislation, while the executive was the
Vice-Chancellorship, which, though legally
elective, was appropriated by the Heads,
and passed down their list in order.
With a single exception, the Headships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
were all clerical, and they were almost
always filled by men of temperament,
to say the least, eminently conservative.
Thus academical liberty and progress
slept.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the eve of another great storm we
have a pleasant glimpse of Oxford life and
study in Clarendon's picture of Falkland's
circle, at Great Tew, within ten
miles of Oxford, whither, he says, "most
polite and accurate men of that University
resorted, dwelling there as in a College
situated in a purer air, so that his was
a University bound in a less volume,
whither his intellectual friends came not
so much for repose as study, and to exam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ine
and refine those grosser propositions
which laziness and consent made current
in conversation." This indicates that,
while study was going on, liberal inquiry
was also on foot. But clouds again gathered,
the storm again came, and once more
from the ecclesiastical quarter. The triumph
of the Reformation, the accession
of a Protestant Queen, and the Chancellorship
of Leicester, who, for politic
purposes, played the Puritan, had been
attended by a general expulsion or secession
of the Romanising party, which left
the University for a time in the hands
of the Calvinists and Low Churchmen.
Hooker, the real father of Anglicanism,
had, for a time, studied Church antiquity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
in the quiet quadrangle of Corpus, but he
had come into collision with Puritanism,
and had, for a time, been driven away by
it. Perhaps its prevalence may have ultimately
inclined him to exchange the University
for a far less congenial sphere.
The clergy, however, of an Episcopal
Church, and one which laid claim to
Apostolical succession, was sure in time
to come round to High Church doctrine.
To High Church doctrine the clergy of
Oxford did come round under the leadership
of Laud, University Preacher, Proctor,
President of St. John's College, and
afterwards Chancellor of the University.
Of Laud there are several memorials at
Oxford. One is the inner quadrangle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
St. John's College, ornamented in the style
of Inigo Jones, where the Archbishop and
Chancellor, in the noontide of his career,
received with ecstasies of delight, ecclesiastical,
academical, and political, his
doomed king and master with the fatal
woman at Charles's side. Another is a
fine collection of oriental books added
to the Bodleian Library. A third and
more important is the new code of statutes
framed for the reformation of the
University by its all-powerful Chancellor.
A fourth is the statue of the Virgin and
Child over the porch of St. Mary's Church,
which, as proof of a Romanising tendency,
formed one of the charges against the
Archbishop, though it was really put up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
by his Chaplain. The fifth is the headless
corpse which lies buried in the Chapel
of St. John's College, whither pious hands
conveyed it after the Restoration. Laud
was a true friend of the University and
of learned men, in whom, as in Hales,
he respected the right of inquiry, and to
whom he was willing to allow a freedom
of opinion which he would not allow to
the common herd. He was not so much
a bigot as a martinet. It was by playing
the martinet in ecclesiastical affairs that
he was brought into mortal collision with
the nation. In the code of statutes which
by his characteristic use of autocratic
power he imposed on Oxford the martinet
is betrayed; so is the belief in the effi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>cacy
of regulation. We see the man who
wrecked a kingdom for the sake of his
forms. Nor had Laud the force to deliver
University education from the shackles
of the Middle Ages and the scholastic
system. But the code is dictated by a
genuine spirit of reform, and might have
worked improvement had it been sustained
by a motive power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The period of the Civil War is a gap in
academical history. Its monuments are
only traces of destruction, such as the defacement
of Papistical images and window
paintings by the Puritan soldiery, and the
sad absence of the old College plate, of
which two thousand five hundred ounces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
went to the Royal mint in New Inn Hall,
only a few most sacred pieces, such as the
Founder's drinking-horn at Queen's, and
the covered cup, reputed that of the
Founder, at Corpus, being left to console
us for the irreparable loss. Exeter College
alone seems to have shown compunction;
perhaps there had remained in
her something of the free spirit for which
in the days of Wycliffe she had been
noted. Art and taste may mourn, but the
University, as a centre of Episcopalianism,
had little cause to complain; for the
war was justly called the Bishops' war,
and by the Episcopal Church and the
Queen, between them, Charles was brought
to the block. Oxford was bound by her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
ecclesiasticism to the Royal cause, and she
had the ill luck to be highly available as a
place of arms from her position between
the two rivers, while she formed an advanced
post to the Western country in
which the strength of the King's cause lay.
During those years the University was in
buff and bandolier, on the drill ground
instead of in the Schools, while the Colleges
were filled with the exiled Court and
its ghost of a Parliament. Traces of works
connecting the two rivers were not long
ago to be seen, and tradition points to
the angle in the old city wall under Merton
College as the spot where Windebank,
a Royalist officer, was shot for surrendering
his post. There was a reign of garri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>son
manners as well as of garrison duties,
and to the few who still cared for the objects
of the University, even if they were
Royalists, the surrender of the city to the
Parliament may well have been a relief.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then came Parliamentary visitation
and the purge, with the inevitable violence
and inhumanity. Heads and Fellows,
who refused submission to the new
order of things, were turned out. Mrs.
Fell, the wife of the Dean of Christ
Church, deposed for Royalism, refused
to quit the Deanery, and at last had to
be carried out of the quadrangle, venting
her wrath in strong language as she
went, by a squad of Parliamentary mus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>keteers.
But the Puritans put in good
men: such as Owen, who was made
Dean of Christ Church; Conant, who was
made Rector of Exeter; Wilkins, who
was made Warden of Wadham; and Seth
Ward, the mathematician, who was made
President of Trinity College. Owen and
Conant appear to have been model Heads.
The number of students increased. Evelyn,
the Anglican and Royalist, visiting
Oxford, seems to find the academical
exercises, and the state of the University
generally, satisfactory to his mind. He
liked even the sermon, barring some
Presbyterian animosities. Nor did he
find much change in College Chapels.
New College was "in its ancient garb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
notwithstanding the scrupulosity of the
times." The Chapel of Magdalen College,
likewise, was "in pontifical order,"
and the organ remained undemolished.
The Protectorate was tolerant as far as
the age allowed. Evelyn was cordially
received by the Puritan authorities and
hospitably entertained. Puritanism does
not seem to have been so very grim, whatever
the satirist in "The Spectator" may
say. Tavern-haunting and swearing were
suppressed. So were May-poles and some
innocent amusements. But instrumental
music was much cultivated, as we learn
from the Royalist and High Church antiquary
Anthony Wood, from whom, also,
we gather that dress, though less donnish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
was not more austere. Cromwell, having
saved the Universities from fanatics who
would have laid low all institutions of
worldly learning, made himself Chancellor
of Oxford, and sought to draw thence, as
well as from Cambridge, promising youths
for the service of the State. Even Clarendon
admits that the Restoration found
the University "abounding in excellent
learning," notwithstanding "the wild and
barbarous depopulation" which it had
undergone; a miraculous result, which he
ascribes, under God's blessing, to "the
goodness and richness of the soil, which
could not be made barren by all the
stupidity and negligence, but choked the
weeds, and would not suffer the poison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>ous
seeds, which were sown with industry
enough, to spring up." Puritanism might
be narrow and bibliolatrous, but it was
not obscurantist nor the enemy of science.
We see this in Puritan Oxford as well as
in Puritan Harvard and Yale. In Puritan
Oxford the scientific circle which afterwards
gave birth to the Royal Society
was formed. Its chief was Warden Wilkins,
and it included Boyle, Wallis, Seth
Ward, and Wren. It met either in Wilkins's
rooms at Wadham, or in those of
Boyle. Evelyn, visiting Wilkins, is ravished
with the scientific inventions and
experiments which he sees. On the stones
of Oxford, Puritanism has left no trace;
there was hardly any building during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
those years. There were benefactions not
a few, among which was the gift of Selden's
Library.</p>

<p>Upon the Restoration followed a Royalist
proscription, more cruel, and certainly
more lawless, than that of the Puritans
had been. All the good Heads of the
Commonwealth era were ejected, and the
Colleges received back a crowd of Royalists,
who, during their exclusion, had probably
been estranged from academical
pursuits. Anthony Wood himself is an
unwilling witness to the fact that the
change was much for the worse. "Some
Cavaliers that were restored," he says,
"were good scholars, but the majority
were dunces." "Before the War," he says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in another place, "we had scholars who
made a thorough search in scholastic and
polemical divinity, in humane learning and
natural philosophy, but now scholars study
these things not more than what is just
necessary to carry them through the exercises
of their respective Colleges and the
University. Their aim is not to live as
students ought to do, temperate, abstemious,
and plain in their apparel, but to live
like gentry, to keep dogs and horses, to
turn their studies into places to keep bottles,
to swagger in gay apparel and long
periwigs." Into the Rectorship of Exeter,
in place of the excellent Conant, was put
Joseph Maynard, of whom Wood says,
"Exeter College is now much debauched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
by a drunken Governor; whereas, before,
in Doctor Conant's time, it was accounted
a civil house, it is now rude and uncivil.
The Rector is good-natured, generous,
and a good scholar, but he has forgot the
way of College life, and the decorum of a
scholar. He is much given to bibbing,
and when there is a music meeting in one
of the Fellow's chambers, he will sit there,
smoke, and drink till he is drunk, and has
to be led to his lodgings by the junior
Fellows." This is not the only evidence
of the fact that drinking, idling, and
tavern-haunting were in the ascendant.
Study as well as morality, having been the
badge of the Puritan, was out of fashion.
Wilkins's scientific circle took its depart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ure
from Oxford to London, there to
become the germ of the Royal Society.
The hope was gone at Oxford of a race of
"young men provided against the next
age, whose minds, receiving the first impressions
of sober and generous knowledge,
should be invincibly armed against
all the encroachments of enthusiasm."
The presence of the merry monarch, with
his concubines, at Oxford, when his Parliament
met there, was not likely to improve
morals. Oxford sank into an organ of
the High Church and Tory party, and
debased herself by servile manifestos in
favour of government by prerogative.
Non-conformists were excluded by the
religious tests, the operation of which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
more stringent than ever since the passing
of the Act of Uniformity. The love
of liberty and truth embodied in Locke
was expelled from Christ Church; not,
however, by the act of the College or of
the University, but by Royal warrant,
though Fell, Dean of Christ Church,
bowed slavishly to the tyrant's pleasure;
so that Christ Church may look with little
shame on the portrait of the philosopher,
which now hangs triumphant in her Hall.
The Cavaliers did not much, even in the
way of building. The Sheldonian Theatre
was given them by the Archbishop, to
whom subscriptions had been promised,
but did not come in, so that he had to
bear the whole expense himself. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
so deeply disgusted that he refused ever to
look upon the building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the gateway of University College
stands the statue of James II. That it
should have been left there is a proof both
of the ingrained Toryism of old Oxford,
and of the mildness of the Revolution of
1688. Obadiah Walker, the Master of the
Colleges, was one of the political converts
to Roman Catholicism, and it was in ridicule
of him that "Old Obadiah, Ave
Maria," was sung by the Oxford populace.
A set of rooms in the same quadrangle
bears the trace of its conversion into a
Roman Catholic Chapel for the king. It
faces the rooms of Shelley. Reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was made the other day, in an ecclesiastical
lawsuit, to the singular practice which
prevails in this College, of filing out into
the ante-chapel after the sacrament to consume
the remains of the bread and wine,
instead of consuming them at the altar
or communion table. This probably is
a trace of the Protestant reaction which
followed the transitory reign of Roman
Catholicism under Obadiah Walker. All
are familiar with the Magdalen College
case, and with the train of events by
which the most devoutly royalist of Universities
was brought, by its connection
with the Anglican Church and in defence
of the Church's possessions, into collision
with the Crown, and arrayed for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
moment on the side of constitutional liberty.
After the Revolution the recoil
quickly followed. Oxford became the
stronghold of Jacobitism, the scene of
treasonable talk over the wine in the
Common Room, of riotous demonstrations
by pot-valiant undergraduates in the
streets, of Jacobite orations at academical
festivals, amid frantic cheers of the assembled
University, of futile plotting and
puerile conspiracies which never put a
man in the field. "The king to Oxford
sent a troop of horse." But the troop of
horse was not called upon to act. There
was a small Hanoverian and constitutional
party, and now and then it scored
a point against its adversaries, who dared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
not avow their disloyalty to the reigning
dynasty. A Jacobite Proctor, having
intruded into a convivial meeting of
Whigs, they tendered him the health of
King George, which, for fear of the treason
law, he was fain to drink upon his knees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the early part of the eighteenth century
there was some intellectual life in
Christ Church, to which Westminster
still sent up good scholars, and which was
the resort of the nobility, in whom youthful
ambition and desire for improvement
might be stirred by the influences of political
homes, and the prospects of a public
life. Dean Aldrich was a scholar and
a virtuoso. The spire of All Saints' Church
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
is a soaring monument of his
taste, if not of his genius, for architecture.
In the controversy with Bentley about
the Epistles of Phalaris, Christ Church,
though she was hopelessly in the wrong,
showed that she had some learning and
some interest in classical studies. Otherwise
the eighteenth century is a blank, or
worse than a blank, in the history of the
University. The very portraits on the
College walls disclose the void of any but
ecclesiastical eminence. That tendency to
torpor, which, as Adam Smith and Turgot
have maintained, is inherent in the system
of endowments, fell upon Oxford in full
measure. The Colleges had now, by the
increase in value of their estates, become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
rich, some of them very rich. The estates
of Magdalen, Gibbon tells us, were
thought to be worth thirty thousand
pounds a year, equivalent to double that
sum now. Instead of being confined to
their original Commons and Livery, the
Heads and Fellows, as administrators of
the estate, were now dividing among
themselves annually large rentals, though
they failed to increase in equal proportion
the stipends of the Scholars and others
who had no share in the administration.
The statutes of medi&aelig;val Founders had
become utterly obsolete, and were disregarded,
notwithstanding the oath taken
to observe them, or observed only so far
as they guarded the interest of sine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>curists
against the public. Nor were any
other duties assumed. A few of the Fellows
in each College added to their income
by holding the tutorships, the functions of
which they usually performed in the most
slovenly way, each Tutor professing to
teach all subjects, while most of them
knew none. In the Common Room, with
which each of the Colleges now provided
itself, the Fellows spent lives of Trulliberian
luxury, drinking, smoking, playing at
bowls, and, as Gibbon said, by their deep
but dull potations excusing the brisk intemperance
of youth. Even the obligation
to residence was relaxed, and at last
practically annulled, so that a great part
of the Fellowships became sinecure sti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>pends
held by men unconnected with the
University. About the only restriction
which remained was that on marriage.
Out of this the Heads had managed to slip
their necks, and from the time of Elizabeth
downwards there had been married
Heads, to the great scandal of Anthony
Wood and other academical precisians, to
whom, in truth, one lady, at least, the wife
of Warden Clayton of Merton, seems to
have afforded some grounds for criticism
by her usurpations. But in the case of
the Fellows, the statute, being not constructive,
but express, could not be evaded
except by stealth, and by an application of
the aphorism then current, that he might
hold anything who would hold his tongue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
The effect of this, celibacy being no
longer the rule, was to make all the Fellows
look forward to the benefices, of a
number of which each College was the
patron, and upon which they could marry.
Thus devotion to a life of study or education
in College, had a Fellow been inclined
to it, was impossible, under the ordinary
conditions of modern life. Idleness, intemperance,
and riot were rife among the
students, as we learn from the novels and
memoirs of the day. Especially were
they the rule among the noblemen and
gentlemen-commoners, who were privileged
by their birth and wealth, and to
whom by the servility of the Dons every
license was allowed. Some Colleges took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
only gentlemen-commoners, who paid
high fees and did what they pleased. All
Souls' took no students at all, and became
a mere club which, by a strange perversion
of a clause in their statutes, was limited
to men of high family. The University
as a teaching and examining body
had fallen into a dead swoon. Few of the
Professors even went through the form of
lecturing, and the statutory obligation of
attendance was wholly disregarded by the
students. The form of medi&aelig;val disputations
was kept up by the farcical repetition
of strings of senseless syllogisms,
which were handed down from generation
to generation of students. The very nomenclature
of the system had become un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>meaning.
Candidates for the theological
degree paced the Divinity School for an
hour, nominally challenging opponents to
disputation, but the door was locked by
the Bedel, that no opponent might appear.
Examinations were held, but the
candidates, by feeing the University officer,
were allowed to choose their own
examiners, and they treated the examiner
after the ordeal. The two questions,
"What is the meaning of Golgotha?" and
"Who founded University College?" comprised
the examination upon which Lord
Eldon took his degree. A little of that
elegant scholarship, with the power of writing
Latin verses, of which Addison was
the cynosure, was the most of which Ox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ford
could boast. Even this there could
hardly have been had not the learned
languages happened to have formed an
official part of the equipment of the clerical
profession. Of science, or the mental
habit which science forms, there was none.
Such opportunities for study, such libraries,
such groves, a livelihood so free from
care could scarcely fail, now and then, to
give birth to a learned man, an Addison, a
Lowth, a Thomas Warton, an Elmsley, a
Martin Routh.</p>

<p>The Universities being the regular finishing
schools of the gentry and the professions,
men who had passed through
them became eminent in after life, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
they owed little or nothing to the University.
Only in this way can Oxford lay
claim to the eminence of Bishop Butler,
Jeremy Bentham, or Adam Smith, while
Gibbon is her reproach. The figures of
Lord Eldon and Lord Stowell, whose ponderous
twin statues sit side by side in the
Library of University College, were more
academical, especially that of Lord Stowell,
who was Tutor of his College, and held
a lectureship of Ancient History. Here
and there a Tutor of the better stamp, no
doubt, would try to do his duty by his
pupils. A rather pathetic interest attaches
to Richard Newton, who tried to turn
Hart Hall into a real place of education,
and had some distinguished pupils, among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
them Charles Fox. But the little lamp
which he had kindled went out in the
uncongenial air. On the site, thanks to
the munificence of Mr. Baring, now stands
Hertford College. Johnson's residence at
Pembroke College was short, and his narrative
shows that it was unprofitable, though
his High Church principles afterwards
made him a loyal son and eulogist of the
University. One good effect the interdiction
of marriage had. It kept up a sort of
brotherhood, and saved corporate munificence
from extinction by the private interest
of fathers of families. As the College
revenues increased, building went on,
though after the false classical fashion of
the times and mostly for the purpose of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
College luxury. Now rose the new quadrangle
of Queen's, totally supplanting the
medi&aelig;val College, and the new buildings
at Magdalen and Corpus. A plan is extant,
horrible to relate, for the total demolition
of the old quadrangle of Magdalen,
and its replacement by a modern palace
of idleness in the Italian style. To this
century belong Peckwater and Canterbury
quadrangles, also in the classical style, the
first redeemed by the Library which fills
one side of the square, and which has a
heavy architectural grandeur as well as
a noble purpose. To the eighteenth century
we also mainly owe the College gardens
and walks as we see them; and the
gardens of St. John's, New College, Wad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>ham,
Worcester, and Exeter, with the lime
walk at Trinity and the Broadwalk&mdash;now
unhappily but a wreck&mdash;at Christ Church,
may plead to a student's heart for some
mitigation of the sentence on the race of
clerical idlers and wine-bibbers, who, for
a century, made the University a place,
not of education and learning, but of dull
sybaritism, and a source, not of light, but
of darkness, to the nation. It is sad to
think how different the history of England
might have been had Oxford and Cambridge
done their duty, like Harvard and
Yale, during the last century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>At the end of the last or beginning of
the present century came the revival. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the end of the last century Christ Church
had some brilliant classical scholars among
her students, though the great scene of
their eminence was not the study but the
senate. The portraits of Wellesley and
Canning hang in her Hall. In the early
part of the present century the general
spirit of reform and progress, which had
been repressed during the struggle with
revolutionary France, began to move again
over the face of the torpid waters. Eveleigh,
Provost of Oriel, led the way. At
his College and at Balliol the elections
to Fellowships were free from local or
genealogical restrictions. They were now
opened to merit, and those two Colleges,
though not among the first in wealth or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
magnificence, attained a start in the race
of regeneration which Balliol, being very
fortunate in its Heads, has since in a
remarkable manner maintained. The examination
system of Laud had lacked a
motive power, and had depended, like his
policy, on his fiat instead of vital force.
There was no sufficient inducement for
the examiner to be strict or for the candidate
to excel. The motive power was now
supplied by a list of honours in classics
and mathematics, and among the earliest
winners in the first class in both schools
was Robert Peel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had the University
begun to awake to a new life, when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
was swept by another ecclesiastical storm,
the consequence of its unhappy identification
with clericism and the State Church.
The liberal movement which commenced
after the fall of Napoleon and carried the
Reform Bill, threatened to extend to the
religious field, and to withdraw the support
of the State from the Anglican
Church. This led the clergy to look out
for another basis, which they found in the
reassertion of High Church and sacerdotal
doctrines, such as apostolical succession,
eucharistical real presence, and baptismal
regeneration. Presently the movement assumed
the form of a revival of the Church
of the Middle Ages, such as High Church
imagination pictured it, and ultimately of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
secession to Rome. Oxford, with her medi&aelig;val
buildings, her High Church tradition,
her half-monastic Colleges, and her
body of unmarried clergy, became the
centre of the movement. The Romanising
tendencies of Tractarianism, as from
the "Tracts for the Times" it was called,
visible from the first, though disclaimed
by the leaders, aroused a fierce Protestant
reaction, which encountered Tractarianism
both in the press and in the councils
of the University. The Armageddon of
the ecclesiastical war was the day on
which, in a gathering of religious partisans
from all sections of the country
which the Convocation House would not
hold, so that it was necessary to adjourn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to the Sheldonian Theatre, Ward, the
most daring of the Tractarian writers,
after a scene of very violent excitement,
was deprived of his degree. This was the
beginning of the end. Newman, the real
leader of the movement, though Pusey,
from his academical rank, was the official
leader, soon recognised the place to which
his principles belonged, and was on his
knees before a Roman Catholic priest,
supplicating for admission to the Church
of Rome. A ritualistic element remained,
and now reigns, in the Church of England;
but the party which Newman left,
bereft of Newman, broke up, and its relics
were cast like drift-wood on every theological
or philosophical shore. Newman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
poetic version of medi&aelig;val religion, together
with the spiritual graces of his
style and his personal influence, had for
a time filled the imaginations and carried
away the hearts of youth, while the
seniors were absorbed in the theological
controversy, renounced lay studies, and
disdained educational duty except as it
might afford opportunities of winning
youthful souls to the Neo-Catholic faith.
Academical duty would have been utterly
lost in theological controversy, had it not
been for the Class List, which bound the
most intellectual undergraduates to lay
studies by their ambition, and kept on
foot a staff of private teachers, "coaches,"
as they were called, to prepare men for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the examinations, who did the duty which
the ecclesiastical Fellows of the University
disdained. The Oxford movement
has left a monument of itself in the College
founded in memory of Keble, the
gentle and saintly author of "The Christian
Year." It has left an ampler monument
in the revival of medi&aelig;val architecture
at Oxford, and the style of new
buildings which everywhere meet the eye.
The work of the Oxford Architectural
Society, which had its birth in the Neo-Catholic
movement, may prove more durable
than that movement itself. Of the
excess to which the architectural revival
was carried, the new Library at University
College, more like a medi&aelig;val Chapel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
than a Library, is a specimen. It was
proposed to give Neo-Catholicism yet
another monument by erecting close to
the spot where Cranmer, Latimer, and
Ridley died for truth, the statue of Cardinal
Newman, the object of whose pursuit
through life had been, not truth, but
an ecclesiastical ideal. Of the reaction
against the Tractarian movement the
monument is the memorial to the Protestant
martyrs Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley,
the subscription for which commenced
among the Protestants who had come up
to vote for the condemnation of Ward, and
which Tractarians scornfully compared to
the heap of stones raised over the body of
Achan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here ended the reign of ecclesiasticism,
of the Middle Ages, and of religious exclusion.
The collision into which Romanising
Oxford had been brought with the
Protestantism of the British nation, probably
helped to bring on the revolution
which followed, and which restored the
University to learning, science, and the
nation. The really academical element in
the University invoked the aid of the
national government and Legislature. A
Royal Commission of Inquiry into the
state of the University and its Colleges
was appointed, and though some Colleges
closed their muniment rooms, and inquiry
was obstructed, enough was revealed in
the Report amply to justify legislative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
reform and emancipation. An act of
Parliament was passed which set free the
University and Colleges alike from their
medi&aelig;val statutes, restored the University
Professoriate, opened the Fellowships to
merit, and relaxed the religious tests.
The curriculum, the examination system,
and the honour list were liberalised, and
once more, as in early times, all the great
departments of knowledge were recognised
and domiciled in the University.
Science, long an exile, was welcomed
back to her home at the moment when
a great extension of her empire was at
hand. Strictly professional studies, such
as practical law and medicine, could not
be recalled from their professional seats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Elections to Fellowships by merit replaced
election by local or school preferences,
by kinship, or by the still more
objectionable influences which at one time
had been not unfelt. Colleges which had
declined the duty of education, which had
been dedicated to sinecurism and indolence,
and whose quadrangles had stood
empty, were filled with students, and once
more presented a spectacle which would
have gladdened the heart of the Founder.
A Commission, acting on a still more
recent Act of Parliament, has carried the
adaptation of Oxford to the modern requirements
of science and learning further
than the old Commission, which acted in
the penumbra of medi&aelig;val and ecclesiasti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>cal
tradition, dared. The intellectual Oxford
of the present day is almost a fresh
creation. Its spirit is new; it is liberal,
free, and progressive. It is rather too
revolutionary, grave seniors say, so far as
the younger men are concerned. This is
probably only the first forward bound of
recovered freedom, which will be succeeded
in time by the sober pace of learning
and scientific investigation. Again,
as in the thirteenth century, the day of
Grosseteste and Simon de Montfort, Oxford
is a centre of progress, instead of
being, as under the later Stuarts, the
stronghold of reaction. Of the College
revival, the monuments are all around in
the new buildings, for which increasing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
numbers have called, and which revived
energy has supplied. Christ Church, New
College, Magdalen, Merton, Balliol, Trinity,
University have all enlarged their
courts, and in almost every College new
life has been shown by improvement or
restoration. Of the reign of medi&aelig;valism
the only trace is the prevalence in the new
buildings of the medi&aelig;val style, which
architectural harmony seemed to require,
though the new buildings of Christ
Church and Trinity are proofs of a happy
emancipation from architectural tradition.
The University revival has its monument
in the new examination Schools in High
Street, where the student can no longer
get his degree by giving the meaning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Golgotha and the name of the Founder
of University College. There are those
who, like Mark Pattison, look on it with
an evil eye, regarding the examination
system as a noxious excrescence and as
fatal to spontaneous study and research;
though they would hardly contend that
spontaneous study and research flourished
much at Oxford before the revival of examinations,
or deny that since the revival
Oxford has produced the fruits of study
and research, at least to a fair extent.
The restoration of science is proclaimed
by the new Museum yonder; a strange
structure, it must be owned, which symbolises,
by the unfitness of its style for its
purpose, at once the unscientific character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of the Middle Ages, and the lingering
attachment of Oxford to the medi&aelig;val
type. Of the abolition of the religious
tests, and the restoration of the University
to the nation, a monument is Mansfield
College for Congregationalists, a
vision of which would have thrown an
orthodox and Tory Head of a College
into convulsions half a century ago.
Even here the medi&aelig;val style of architecture
keeps its hold, though the places
of Catholic Saints are taken by the statues
of Wycliffe, Luther, John Knox, Whitefield,
and Wesley. By the side of Mansfield
College rises also Manchester College
for Independents, in the same architectural
style. Neither of them, however, is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the Oxford sense a College; both are
places of theological instruction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the North of the city, where fifty
years ago stretched green fields, is now
seen a suburb of villas, all of them bespeaking
comfort and elegance, few of
them overweening wealth. These are
largely the monuments of another great
change, the removal of the rule of celibacy
from the Fellowships, and the introduction
of a large body of married
teachers devoted to their profession, as
well as of the revival of the Professorships,
which were always tenable by married men.
Fifty years ago the wives of Heads of
Houses, who generally married late in life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
if they married at all, constituted, with
one or two officers of the University, the
whole female society of Oxford. The
change was inevitable, if education was to
be made a profession, instead of being, as
it had been in the hands of celibate Fellows
of Colleges, merely the transitory
occupation of a man whose final destination
was the parish. Those who remember
the old Common Room life, which is
now departing, cannot help looking back
with a wistful eye to its bachelor ease,
its pleasant companionship, its interesting
talk and free interchange of thought, its
potations neither "deep" nor "dull." Nor
were its symposia without important fruits
when such men as Newman and Ward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
on one side, encountered such men as
Whately, Arnold, and Tait, on the other
side, in Common Room talk over great
questions of the day. But the life became
dreary when a man had passed forty, and
it is well exchanged for the community
that fills those villas, and which, with its
culture, its moderate and tolerably equal
incomes, permitting hospitality but forbidding
luxury, and its unity of interests with
its diversity of acquirements and accomplishments,
seems to present the ideal conditions
of a pleasant social life. The only
question is, how the College system will be
maintained when the Fellows are no longer
resident within the walls of the College to
temper and control the younger members,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
for a barrack of undergraduates is not a
good thing. The personal bond and intercourse
between Tutor and pupil under
the College system was valuable as well as
pleasant; it cannot be resigned without
regret. But its loss will be compensated
by far superior teaching. Half a century
ago conservatism strove to turn the railway
away from Oxford. But the railway
came, and it brings, on summer Sundays,
to the city of study and thought not a few
leaders of the active world. Oxford is
now, indeed, rather too attractive; her
academical society is in danger of being
swamped by the influx of non-academical
residents.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The buildings stand, to mark by their
varying architecture the succession of the
changeful centuries through which the
University has passed. In the Libraries
are the monuments of the successive generations
of learning. But the tide of
youthful life that from age to age has
flowed through college, quadrangle, hall,
and chamber, through University examination-rooms
and Convocation Houses,
has left no memorials of itself except the entries
in the University and College books;
dates of matriculation, which tell of the
bashful boy standing before the august
Vice-Chancellor at entrance; dates of degrees,
which tell of the youth putting
forth, from his last haven of tutelage, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the waves of the wide world. Hither they
thronged, century after century, in the
costume and with the equipments of their
times, from medi&aelig;val abbey, grange, and
hall, from Tudor manor-house and homestead,
from mansion, rectory, and commercial
city of a later day, bearing with them
the hopes and affections of numberless
homes. Year after year they departed,
lingering for a moment at the gate to say
farewell to College friends, the bond with
whom they vowed to preserve, but whom
they were never to see again, then stepped
forth into the chances and perils of life,
while the shadow on the College dial
moved on its unceasing round. If they
had only left their names in the rooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
which they had occupied, there would be
more of history than we have in those dry
entries in the books. But, at all events,
let not fancy frame a history of student
life at Oxford out of "Verdant Green."
There are realities corresponding to "Verdant
Green," and the moral is, that many
youths come to the University who had
better stay away, since none get any good
and few fail to get some harm, saving those
who have an aptitude for study. But the
dissipation, the noisy suppers, the tandem-driving,
the fox-hunting, the running away
from Proctors, or, what is almost as bad,
the childish devotion to games and sports
as if they were the end of existence,
though they are too common a part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
undergraduate life in the University of the
rich, are far from being the whole of it.
Less than ever are they the whole of it
since University reform and a more liberal
curriculum have increased, as certainly
they have, industry and frugality at
the same time. Of the two or three thousand
lamps which to-night will gleam from
those windows, few will light the supper-table
or the gambling-table; most will
light the book. Youthful effort, ambition,
aspiration, hope, College character and
friendship have no artist to paint them,&mdash;at
least as yet they have had none. But
whatever of poetry belongs to them is
present in full measure here.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
